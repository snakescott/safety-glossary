# Cognitive SRE

[From the SREcon20 America's West Call for Participation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americaswest/call-for-participation)

> For 2020, we've decided to dive deeper into how SREs work, including examining deep work, controlling for cognitive load, and sensemaking. There are many forms of work that SREs are required to do to be effective, whether it's doing archaeology on a legacy service, a perplexing debug story that took you into the internals of a system, or mastering a tool you use in your day-to-day. We want to hear it all.
