# Cognitive SRE

[From the SREcon20 America's West Call for Participation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon20americaswest/call-for-participation)

> For 2020, we've decided to dive deeper into how SREs work, including examining deep
> work, controlling for cognitive load, and sensemaking. There are many forms of work
> that SREs are required to do to be effective, whether it's doing archaeology on a
> legacy service, a perplexing debug story that took you into the internals of a system,
> or mastering a tool you use in your day-to-day. We want to hear it all.
